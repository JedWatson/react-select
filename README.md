React-Select
============

A Select control built with and for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), initially being developed for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [jedwatson.github.io/react-select](http://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
gulp watch:examples
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Project Status

This is currently a work in progress.

It's loosely based on [Selectize](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) (in terms of behaviour and user expereience) and [React-Autocomplete](https://github.com/rackt/react-autocomplete) (as a native React Combobox implemenation), as well as other select controls including [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) and [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/).

TODO:

- Remote options loading (done)
- Cleanup of focus state management (done)
- Standalone build & publish to Bower (done)
- Multiselect (done)
- CSS Styles and theme support (working, could be improved)
- Documentation website (currently just examples)
- Custom options rendering


## Installation

The easiest way to use React-Select is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/select.js` and `dist/default.css` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React and Underscore. (they must be available through a browserify-style `require()` call, standalone support is coming soon)

```
npm install react-select --save
```


## Usage

React-Select generates a hidden text field containing the selected value, so you can submit it as part of a standard form. You can also listen for changes with the `onChange` event property.

Options should be provided as an `Array` of `Object`s, each with a `value` and `label` property for rendering and searching.

When the value is changed, `onChange(newValue, [selectedOptions])` will fire.

```
var Select = require('react-select');

var options = [
	{ value: 'one', label: 'One' },
	{ value: 'two', label: 'Two' }
];

function logChange(val) {
	console.log("Selected: " + val);
}

<Select
	name="form-field-name"
	value="one"
	options={options}
/>
```

### Multiselect options

You can enable multi-value selection by setting `multi="true"`. In this mode:

* Selected options will be removed from the dropdown menu
* The values of the selected items are joined using the `delimiter` property to create the input value
* A simple value, if provided, will be split using the `delimiter` property
* The `onChange` event provides an array of the selected options as the second argument

### Async options

If you want to load options asynchronously, instead of providing an `options` Array, provide a `asyncOptions` Function.

The function takes two arguments `String input, Function callback`and will be called when the input text is changed.

When your async process finishes getting the options, pass them to `callback(err, data)` in a Object `{ options: [] }`.

The select control will intelligently cache options for input strings that have already been fetched. Async options will still be filtered like the normal options array, so if your async process would only return a smaller set of results for a more specific query, also pass `complete: true` in the callback object.

Unless you specify the property `autoload="false"` the control will automatically load the default set of options (i.e. for `input: ''`) when it is mounted.

```
var Select = require('react-select');

var getOptions = function(input, callback) {
	setTimeout(function() {
		callback(null, {
			options: [
				{ value: 'one', label: 'One' },
				{ value: 'two', label: 'Two' }
			],
			complete: true
		});
	}, 500);
};

<Select
	name="form-field-name"
	value="one"
	asyncOptions={getOptions}
/>
```

### Filtering optons

You can control how options are filtered with the following properties:

* `matchPos`: `"start"` or `"any"`: whether to match the text entered at the start or any position in the option value
* `matchProp`: `"label"`, `"value"` or `"any"`: whether to match the value, label or both values of each option when filtering

Both properties default to `"any"`.

#### Advanced filters

You can also completely replace the method used to filter either a single option, or the entire options array (allowing custom sort mechanisms, etc.)

* `filterOption`: `function(Object option, String filter)` returns `Boolean`. Will override `matchPos` and `matchProp` options.
* `filterOptions`: `function(Array options, String filter, Array currentValues)` returns `Array filteredOptions`. Will override `filterOption`, `matchPos` and `matchProp` options.

For multi-select inputs, when providing a custom `filterOptions` method, remember to exclude current values from the returned array of options.
