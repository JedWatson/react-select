## v2.2.0 / 2018-12-28

### Bug Fixes

- [#3296](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3296) Fix for tab interactions when in composition mode with an IME. Thanks [yshr446](https://github.com/yshr446) for the PR.
- [#3302](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3302) Fix to breaking android and mobile safari touch bug [#2755](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2755), by adding more conscientious checks to the onTouchStart and onTouchMove listeners. Thanks [xakep139](https://github.com/xakep139) for the PR.
- [#3303](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3303) Input and GroupHeading components now get passed the selectProps prop, thanks [maxmarchuk](https://github.com/maxmarchuk) for the PR.
- [#3260](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3260) As a result of the CSP nonce support feature, the emotion instance is now cached and passed down to all internal components, meaning that users looking to heavily customise their Select components can do so without externally importing emotion, and nonce instances are respected per select instance. Please see [this segment](https://react-select.com/styles#cx-and-custom-components) in the docs for a more detailed explanation.

## v2.0.0 / 2018-07-23

- async select now accepts a filterOptions function as a prop [#2822](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2822)
- [BREAKING] react-select now exports react-select.esm.js from dist instead of react-select.es.js [#2641](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2641)
- [BREAKING] innerRef assignments in custom components must now be made from the root of the prop object, as opposed to reaching into innerProps. This is part of the work to normalize the behaviour circa custom components. [#2824](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2824)
- className and classNamePrefix deprecation warning and backward compatibility removed. className now only affects the select container, classNamePrefix prefixes all internal components. [#2820](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2820)
- Added `closeMenuOnScroll` prop, which can either be a `boolean` or a `function`, if set to `true` the select menu will close on scroll of the document/body. If a function is supplied, it must take the following shape `(event: ScrollEvent) => boolean`, the boolean value will be used to resolve whether the menu should be closed or stay open. [#2809](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2809), thanks [Vynlar](https://github.com/Vynlar) for this.
- Added fix to support IME inputs. [#2767](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2767), thanks [shamabe](https://github.com/shamabe)
- Removed primitives, and normalise multi-value components to be in line with existing component customisation patterns. [#2821](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2821)
- Normalised isOptionDisabled to be inline with its sibling prop isOptionSelected. [#2821](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2695) Thanks [SimeonC](https://github.com/SimeonC)
- [#2814](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2814) Added memoization to custom components within Select.js as well as in the exported makeAnimated factory method. Thanks to [Alex Reardon's](https://github.com/alexreardon) [memoize-one](https://github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one)
- [#2652](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2652), Async Select now re-evaluates defaultOptions on componentWillReceiveProps. Thanks [jesstelford](https://github.com/jesstelford)

## v2.0.0-beta.7 / 2018-07-03

- Removed old aria-attributes in Option, MenuList and other components in favor of an aria-live-region implementation. `screenReaderStatus` prop is still at the moment untouched, and `aria-labelledby` and `aria-label` props are still available and retain their functionality. See [#2581](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2581).
- Internal ref `input` is now `inputRef` for consistency.
- Internal ref `menuRef` is now `menuListRef` for consistency.
- Fixed bug with MultiValueRemove interaction not working in mobile [#2762](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2762), thanks [chuckbergeron](https://github.com/chuckbergeron).
- Added makeAnimated function export, that takes passed in components and wraps them in higher order components that expose animated functionality. [#2724](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2724)
- Added functionality to not render the menu if `noOptionsMessage` or `loadingMessage` are set to null. [#2754](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2754)
- Fixed bug with mobile menu being blocked when `menuShouldBlockScroll` is true.
  [#2756](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2756)
- Enabled hideSelectedOptions functionality for single-select as well. Changed logic so that if isMulti is true and hideSelectedOptions is not defined, we will hide selected options by default. Explicitly setting hideSelectedOptions will override this behaviour. https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2753
- Updates to flow types, thanks [mike1808](https://github.com/mike1808), [himerus](https://github.com/himerus),
  [teamable-software](https://github.com/teamable-software) and
- Bumped internal flow-bin dependency to 0.72.0, [#2646](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2646) thanks [lunij](https://github.com/lunij)
- Fixed [#2701](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2701), use of un-polyfilled array.includes() in Select.js, this has now been subbed out for a IE compatible implementation.
- [#2733](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2733), fixed classname bug to do with prefixing classes with modifiers.
- [#2723](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2732), fixed emotion compilation bug blocking loadingDot rendering.
- [#2749](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2749) fixed typo in docs. thanks [JuhQ](https://github.com/juhq)
- [#2717](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/2717) added selected value to onChange to accommodate multi-select, thanks [SimeonC](https://github.com/simeonc)

## v2.0.0-beta.6 / 2018-05-23

- Fixed bug with `css` attribute being wrongly applied to a DOM element in SingleValue. Thanks [guigs](http://github.com/guigs)
- Added `removedValue` to the `actionMeta` of the `remove-value` action that's passed into the `onChange` prop.
- Reverted previous change of `innerRef` in `innerProps` of custom Components to `ref`. The property is now once again named `innerRef`. This is mostly to resolve issues with styled-components not passing `ref` down to wrapped dom elements, however this is also a safer pattern to apply as it requires users providing their own custom components to explicitly associate the passed down ref with the requisite dom element.
- selectValue now filters items based on the getOptionValue method. Thanks (inv8der)[http://github.com/inv8der]
- Added `createOptionPosition` to creatable select to allow users to specify where the createOption element appears in the menu.
- Added touch handling logic to detect user intent to scroll the page when interacting with the select control.

## v2.0.0-beta.5 / 2018-05-18

- Added `controlShouldRenderValue` prop, defaults to true. Setting it to false disables rendering values in the control. Thanks[Joss Mackison](http://github.com/jossmac)

## v2.0.0-beta.4 / 2018-05-15

- Fixed bug where transition props were being spread onto the DummyInput causing react warnings in the console. Thanks [Mike Gardner](https://github.com/MikeLimeRocket)

## v2.0.0-beta.3 / 2018-05-14

**Note**: There is an important change in this release to the behaviour of `className`.

Previously, `className` would control the class names applied to internal components
as well as the containing element. Now, the `className` prop only controls the class
name of the containing element, and the new prop `classNamePrefix` controls classes
applies to internal components.

Until 2.0.0 final is released, we have added backwards compatibility and a deprecation
warning to cover this change.

- Added `classNamePrefix` prop, which now controls the class names applied to internal components
- Refactored cx internal implementation to reduce specificity of css-in-jss base styles.
- `maxValueHeight` prop removed
- Added `--is-disabled` className modifier to Option component, thanks [eemeli](https://github.com/eemeli)
- Fixed various IE11 issues, see [#2583](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2583)
- Added multi-value keyboard navigation using left and right arrows.

## v1.0.0-beta6 / 2015-11-29

- Test suite complete and passing, with a couple of minor fixes thanks to
  @bruderstein

## v1.0.0-beta5 / 2015-11-08

- Fixes issues relating to serializing simple values into the hidden field

## v1.0.0-beta4 / 2015-11-08

- New default styles that match [Elemental UI](http://elemental-ui.com) and look
  right at home in the new [KeystoneJS Admin UI](http://keystonejs.com)

We're potentially going to ship some theme stylesheets in the future, shout out
on GitHub if this interests you.

## v1.0.0-beta3 / 2015-11-08

- The selected value populated in the hidden field has been fixed (was `"[object Object]"` before)
- Added new `autofocus` prop
- Fixed duplicate key error for options and values with duplicate `value`
  properties
- SCSS variables now have `!default` so you can override them

## v1.0.0-beta2 / 2015-11-06

Changed since beta 1:

- Async options cache works again
- New style props for custom styling the component without modifying css
  classes: `style` `wrapperStyle` `menuStyle` `menuContainerStyle`
- The menu opens and closes correctly when `searchable={false}`, there is still
  some work to do on this use-case

## v1.0.0-beta1 / 2015-11-06

This is a complete rewrite. Major changes include:

- Everything is simpler (I'm nearly done and the source code is only 60% of the
  size of the last version)
- No more timeouts or weird handlers, the restructuring has let me make
  everything more straight-forward
- The options array is no longer preprocessed into state, just retrieved from
  props
- The values array is now initialised in the Options array during render, and
  not stored in state, which along with the change to options makes the
  component more reliable and fixes issues with props not updating correctly
- The component no longer stores its own value in state (ever) - it needs to be
  passed as a prop and handled with `onChange`.
- Complex values are now enabled by default (so you're passed the option object,
  not its value); you can enable the legacy mode with a prop
- The Value and Option components have been cleaned up as well for consistency
- The hidden `<input>` field is now optional and the component is better suited
  to use in a rich React.js app than it was
- You can disable options filtering to do the filtering externally with
  `onInputChange`
- Accents on characters can now be ignored
- The `asyncOptions` prop has been replaced by a new wrapper component:
  `Select.Async`

Note that "Tag mode" (creating options on the fly) isn't reimplemented yet.

A full guide to the breaking changes and new features will be written up soon.
In the meantime please see the new examples.

## v0.8.0 / 2015-10-19

This release contains significant DOM structure and CSS improvements by
@jossmac, including:

- no more `position: absolute` for inner controls
- `display: table` is used for layout, which works in IE8 and above, and
  [all other modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-table)
- less "magic numbers" used for layout, should fix various browser-specific
  alignment issues
- clear "x" control now animates in
- clearer `.Select--multi` className replaces `.Select.is-multi`
- new height & theme variables
- "dropdown" indicator chevron is no longer displayed for multi-select controls

There are no functional changes, but if you've forked the LESS / CSS to create
your own theme you'll want to pay close attention to PR #527 when upgrading to
this version.

## v0.7.0 / 2015-10-10

React Select is updated for React 0.14. If you're still using React 0.13, please

between v0.7.0 and v0.6.12.

`react-select`, please make sure you are running the latest version of node.
