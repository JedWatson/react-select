### Thanks for using react-select!

Before creating an issue...

# Are you asking a question?
Please don't file GitHub issues to ask questions. Use Stack Overflow with a [#react-select](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-select) tag


# Are you reporting a bug or runtime error?
Please include a test case that demonstrates the issue you're reporting!
This is very helpful to maintainers in order to help us see the issue you're seeing.

Here is a Plunker you can fork that has react-select loaded and supports JSX syntax:

You may also find the [online Babel tool](https://babeljs.io/repl/) quite helpful if you wish to use ES6/ES7 syntax not yet supported by the browser you are using.


# Are you making a feature request?
Provide as much information as possible about your requested feature. Here are a few questions you may consider answering:

*   What's your use case? (Tell us about your application and what problem you're trying to solve.)
*   What interface do you have in mind? (What new properties or methods do you think might be helpful?)
*   Can you point to similar functionality with any existing libraries or components? (Working demos can be helpful.)
